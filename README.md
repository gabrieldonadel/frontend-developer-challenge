## About the Chalenge

The solution of this challenge was implemented using React, along with some libraries as Webpack, Babel, Redux ans Axios.  
The application is a simple landing page containing two main sections, one that displays products requested from an api and other that is a form to subscribe into a newsletter.  
For the NewsLetter to work properly I used a RD request found on the Linx Page that subscribe the user to a real newsletter from Linx
